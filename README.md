### Links

## My process
I first looked over the provided design brief to see what the finished product should look like. Then I added the basic structure with HTML, including any images that needed displaying. I then styled this with Tailwind CSS until it looked as close to the design as possible.

### Built with

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I learnt that a button needs wrapping in an a tag with an href attribute in order for it to take you to a link.

```html
<a href="www.google.com">
    <button>Clicking this button will take you to google</button>
</a>
```

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - I referred to these docs for installing Tailwind CSS and how to use the different styling features it offers.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - I could find the font requested in the design brief here.
